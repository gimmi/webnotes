Welcome to WebNotes

WebNotes is a web application where you can write your notes so they are available to anyone online, or just to you.
The goal of this project is somewhat similar to what Martin Fowler calls a Bliki (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html).
You can easily use WebNotes as a desktop app and keep all your notes in your HDD or USB key.
